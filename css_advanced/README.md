# CSS Advanced

Hi! This is my project where I am learning more about CSS. I am trying out things like making boxes move, changing colors, and making my page look good on phones and computers. I am still learning, so some things might not be perfect.

## What is in this project?

- Some layouts with Flexbox
- Trying out CSS Grid
- Making the page work on different screen sizes
- Simple animations and color changes
- Playing with CSS variables

## How to use

You can open the HTML files in your browser and see what happens. I am just practicing, so feel free to look around!
